# book_searc_refactor
## Description
This project was a refactoring of an old app from using REST API to communicate with a mongoose database to using Apallo in combination with GraphQL to directly querry the database. This method of server/database communication greatly simplifies the process of fullstack web development. The new Apollo server had to handle database querry requests as well as an authoration system using serverside generated tokens being sent between the client and server. In other words, this was my first task working in a fullstack development environment.
